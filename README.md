# Arduino-Projects

This repository contains an assortment of projects based on the Arduino Uno.  
These projects are intended to be easy to practice while requiring little to no knowledge of programming and circuits.
Schematics created within Eagle are also available for review.

## Getting Started

Just clone/download the files and any dependencies for your project then upload to your matching circuit.

### Prerequisites

In order to run any Arduino based scripts you must first have an Arudino Uno as well as access to the Arduino IDE.
You can purchase an Arduino Uno or you can consider a starter kit at:
1. Arduino's website: https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-uno-rev3
2. Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/Elegoo-EL-KIT-001-Project-Complete-Tutorial/dp/B01CZTLHGE/

The Arduino IDE can be downloaded from:
1. Arduino's website: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
2. Arduino's online IDE: https://create.arduino.cc/editor
3. sudo apt-get install arduino
4. sudo yum install arduino

Occasionally scripts may require dependencies; in order to properly install them you can either:
1. Use Arduino's IDE Library Manager (available from IDE version 1.6.2 and up).
2: Search github repositories and clone/download the appropriate .zip for your project.  This can be done in a web browser or
thru the "git clone ssh://git@github.com/[username]/[repository-name].git	" command.  Once downloaded, import the library and
restart your IDE.

PCBs can easily be designed within Autodesk's Eagle PCB Design Software:
1. Visit Autodesk's website and make an account: https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview
2. Download, install, and open the schematic, or ".sch" files found within the repository.

### Example installation

1. Purchase a starter kit and learn the names of the various parts.
2. Download the Arduino IDE on Arduino's website.
3. Import any needed libraries specific to your project.
4. Clone the files from the repository.
5. Upload the code to your Arduino Uno.
6. Contribute to further developments.
7. Repeat as needed!
